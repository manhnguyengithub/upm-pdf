		The Regional Rating System - <span class="upm-u">UNIVERSITY</span> <span class="upm-p">PERFORMANCE</span>
		<span class="upm-m">METRICS</span> - <span class="upm-u">U</span><span class="upm-u">P</span><span
			class="upm-m">M</span> has been developed to assess the
		responsiveness of universities in the Fourth Industrial Revolution era through the five core indicators:
		<span class="paragraph-italic">Entrepreneurial Spirit, Innovative Approaches, Digital Transformation, Student Mobility, and Ethical Values.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="paragraph">
		<span class="upm-u">U</span><span class="upm-u">P</span><span
			class="upm-m">M</span> includes a set of 54 indicators across 8 categories following two distinctive
		orientations: research and
		application. Evaluation results are presented in the form of an overall score for the whole institution and a
		score for each category and each indicator, corresponding to a number of Stars ranging from 1 – 5 and 5 Stars
		ELITE.
	</p>
	<p class="paragraph">
		This rating system could bring significant benefits to different stakeholders. Higher-education institutions can
		use it as a benchmark tool for strategic development, as well as evidence-based branding for attracting students
		and potential partners.
	</p>
	<p class="paragraph">
		Benchmarking results can be used as useful indicators for students to select study destinations and for
		employers to recruit qualified human resources. They can also be a reliable source of reference for national
		governments to make future policies or decisions on education.
	</p>
	<p class="paragraph">
		<span class="upm-u">U</span><span class="upm-u">P</span><span
			class="upm-m">M</span> is extremely pleased to inform you the benchmarking results of your institution. This assessment report
		presents the detailed rating results and the data that has been used as the basis for the rating score.
		Hopefully, this would provide you with useful information for your institution’s self-benchmarking and strategic
		governance. In addition, you can use it for your media communication.

	<p class="paragraph">
		Thank you for taking part in <span class="upm-u">U</span><span class="upm-u">P</span><span
